Analysis.ipynb can be run from this folder - first 2 blocks reference EEG.machinelearing_data_BRMH.csv (Psychiatric disorders dataset), next 2 are the same but reference LEMON_EEG.csv which should be generated by the Raw_to_CSV.py script

Raw_to_CSV.py should run from the same folder as extracted LEMON_EEG subject files (raw EEG) - need to edit the .vhdr file data to point to the correct corresponding .eeg and .vmrk data files for each subject.

Additionally, a column "specific.disorder" with the corresponding disorders of the subject has to be included in csv. A sample LEMON_CSV file is included
